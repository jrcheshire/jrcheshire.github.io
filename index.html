	  <p>
	    I'm Jamie, currently a David and Ellen Lee Postdoctoral
	    Scholar Research Associate in Physics at the California
	    Institue of Technology (Caltech). I'm an observational
	    cosmologist interested in studying the physics of the very
	    beginnings of the Universe through measurements of the
	    cosmic microwave background (CMB) and of large-scale
	    structure (LSS). I'm particularly interested in the
	    intersection of data collection/quality and analysis,
	    which is becoming increasingly important as datasets grow
	    and statistical uncertainties shrink.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of
	    Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2017, majoring in Physics
	    and Astronomy with a concentration in computational
	    physics. While at the University of Illinois, I worked on
	    the SPT-3G camera for the <a href="https://pole.uchicago.edu/public/Home.html">South Pole Telescope</a> under
	    Professor Joaquin Vieira. My work in graduate school at the University of
	    Minnesota's Minnesota Institute for Astrophysics, under
	    professer Clem Pryke, focused on the <a href="https://bicepkeck.org">BICEP/<i>Keck</i></a>
	    series of CMB polarization experiments, which are
	    searching for the echoes of the Big Bang from the
	    geographic South Pole. I received my PhD in Astrophysics
	    in 2024. Since arriving at Caltech, in addition to
	    continuing work with BICEP/<i>Keck</i>, I have
	    also joined the <a href="https://spherex.caltech.edu/">SPHEREx</a> (Spectro-Photometer for the
	    History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices
	    Explorer) cosmology science team, probing at the Big Bang
	    from a different direction. More information about my work
	    may be found on my <a href="#research">Research</a> page.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    When I'm not thinking about CMB polarization, I like to
	    play the guitar, read, snuggle with my cat, and hone my
	    amateur barista skills. I am originally from Nashville,
	    Tennessee.

	    A significant aspect of my research involves
	    observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the
	    13.8 billion year-old afterglow of the Big
	    Bang. Fluctuations in this afterglow contain a wealth of
	    information about the early Universe, with much focus
	    currently being directed towards the CMB's polarization. A
	    characteristic parity-odd "B-mode" polarization imprint at
	    ~degree angular scales is a generic prediction of a wide
	    variety of cosmic inflationary models, being uniquely
	    generated at the last scattering surface by primordial
	    gravitational waves (PGW) generated by
	    inflation. Searching for this B-mode polarization pattern
	    then facilitates tight constraints on inflation's energy
	    scale and its possible mechanisms.

	  <p>
	    I am a member of
	    the <a href="http://bicepkeck.org/">BICEP/<i>Keck</i>
	    Collaboration</a>, who have published the most sensitive
	    constraints to date on the amplitude of primordial
	    gravitational waves: \(\sigma(r)=0.009\), yielding a
	    constraint \(r_{0.05}<0.036\) (95% C.L.)
	    (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvL.127o1301A/abstract">The
	    BICEP/Keck Collaboration, Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 151301
	    (2021)</a>). This was achieved and continues to be
	    furthered by fielding a series of small-aperture
	    refracting telescopes at the geographic South Pole to
	    accumulate data at multiple observing frequencies over
	    many seasons of stable Polar winter conditions. The use of
	    small-aperture refractors facilitates tight systematic
	    error control and mitigation, and provides the flexibility
	    to enable regular upgrades.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Another significant aspect of my research is the effort to
	    measure or constrain primordial non-Gaussianity using the
	    SPHEREx space telescope. The most generic and simple
	    models of inflation predict that the fluctuations will be
	    Gaussian â€” distributed like a regular "bell
	    curve". Deviations from this simple assumption, for instance,
	    multiple fields driving the dynamics of inflation, would
	    cause the spectrum of primordial perturbations to deviate
	    from this simple Gaussian. These "non-Gaussianities" may
	    be able to be detected through their influence on the
	    large-scale clustering of galaxies. SPHEREx will conduct a
	    novel all-sky spectral survey, enabling the construction
	    of a "3-D" map of our local Universe with unprecedented
	    fidelity, which we can use to answer these questions. My
	    work with SPHEREx focuses primarily on assessing the
	    impact of systematic errors and effects which could
	    degrade the non-Gaussianity measurement.

	  <p>
	    Engaging the public with real science, providing
	    transparency about science itself and the scientific
	    process, and just sharing our wonder for the incredible
	    Universe we live in are things that have been and remain
	    quite important to me. In graduate school, I was
	    consistently involved
	    with the University of Minnesota's Universe in the Park
	    program, traveling to local parks around the
	    Twin Cities to give talks about various topics in
	    astrophysics and allowing the public to observe through
	    our portable telescopes. I was also involved in the
	    inaugural Twin Cities "Astronomy on Tap" event in 2022,
	    and have given various public talks about CMB cosmology
	    and Antarctic science. I was the recipient of MIfA's "Best
	    Outreach" award for Spring 2019.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Engaging with the public is always something I'm
	    interested in, so please don't hesitate to contact me if
	    you have opportunities in-mind.
